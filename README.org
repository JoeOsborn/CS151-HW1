* How to use this repository
1. Make a new private repository in your personal GitHub account.
2. Once it's created, use the "import from existing repository" feature and use the URL of this repository (=git@github.com:JoeOsborn/cs151-hw1.git=) as the base.
3. Make your repository private and add me (JoeOsborn) as a collaborator/owner (so I can add peer review students later).
4. Check out your copy on your computer and do your work in =master=.
5. Commit changes and push to your repository.

* If the assignment base repository is ever updated
1. (Do this if you haven't yet:) =git remote add upstream git@github.com:JoeOsborn/cs151-hw1.git=
2. =git checkout base=
3. =git pull upstream base=
4. =git checkout master=
5. =git pull upstream master=
6. Resolve any merge issues and make a merge commit.

* When you are ready to submit homework
1. Open a pull request against your own =base= branch.
2. Submit to Sakai:
  - The link to the pull request
  - The hash of the latest commit in the PR
  - Your teammate, if any
  - Any issues or problems I should know about
